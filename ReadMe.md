# EV Infrastructure vs. Adoption: A Data-Driven Exploration
Exploring how the accessibility of EV charging stations influences the adoption of electric vehicles.  
Data from the **U.S. DOE Alternative Fuels Data Center** and the **Electric Vehicle Population dataset**, analyzed using **Excel, SQL, R, and Tableau**.

---

## Project Overview
This project is part of the **CodeAlpha Data Analytics Internship**.  
It focuses on understanding how the availability of EV (Electric Vehicle) charging stations impacts EV adoption rates across regions.  
The analysis uses a structured, data-driven workflow ‚Äî covering **data profiling**, **cleaning**, **logging**, and later **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** and **SQL joins**.

---

## Objective
To explore the relationship between EV adoption and the accessibility of charging stations, and to evaluate whether regions with better charging infrastructure have higher EV penetration.

---

## Data Sources
1. **Electric Vehicle Population Data** ‚Äî from U.S. government open data repositories.  
2. **Alternative Fuel Stations Data** ‚Äî from the U.S. Department of Energy‚Äôs Alternative Fuels Data Center (AFDC).

## Data Cleaning and Profiling Summary
## Data Quality Dimensions Ensured

Both datasets were assessed and cleaned according to seven key data quality dimensions to ensure analytical reliability and transparency:
| Dimension        | Description                                                                  | Example in This Project                                                      |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Accuracy**     | Verified data values against official sources and corrected inconsistencies. | Checked vehicle manufacturers and model names for valid categories.          |
| **Completeness** | Addressed missing fields and ensured key identifiers existed.                | Filled or flagged null entries for `City`, `State`, and `FuelTypeCode`.      |
| **Consistency**  | Standardized naming conventions and data formats.                            | Used consistent `State` abbreviations and unified units for `ElectricRange`. |
| **Timeliness**   | Used the most recent and relevant dataset versions.                          | Incorporated AFDC and EV population data from 2024.                          |
| **Validity**     | Ensured each value met defined data type and domain rules.                   | Confirmed latitude/longitude values were within valid coordinate ranges.     |
| **Uniqueness**   | Removed duplicates across both datasets.                                     | Ensured unique `VIN` (vehicles) and `StationID` (charging stations).         |
| **Integrity**    | Maintained logical and relational consistency.                               | Preserved links between `Make`, `ModelYear`, and associated records.         |


### Electric Vehicle (EV) Dataset
- Handled missing values and standardized column names.  
- Converted date formats and categorical data types for consistency.  
- Calculated `ElectricRange` statistics ‚Äî mean, median, outliers.  
- Logged all cleaning actions in a separate audit file for transparency.

### Alternative Fuel Stations Dataset
- Cleaned station records, standardized addresses, and handled missing ‚ÄúIntersection Directions.‚Äù  
- Converted blank cells to `NULL` for SQL compatibility.  
- Verified latitude/longitude formats for geospatial joins.  
- Created a data cleaning log similar to the EV process.

## Scripts and Workflow
1. **[1_Data_Profiling.R](Scripts/1_Data_Profiling.R)** ‚Äî Profiles both datasets, checks data types, and detects anomalies.  
2. **[2_EV_Data_Cleaning.R](Scripts/2_EV_Data_Cleaning.R)** ‚Äî Cleans and logs the Electric Vehicle dataset.  
3. **[3_Alt_Data_Cleaning_With_Log.R](Scripts/3_Alt_Data_Cleaning_With_Log.R)** ‚Äî Cleans and logs the Alternative Fuel Stations dataset.

## üßæ Next Steps ‚Äî Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Before proceeding to visualization and SQL joins, the next step is to:
- Ask meaningful questions such as:  
  *How does charger density relate to EV count per state or city?*  
  *Do regions with more public fast chargers show higher EV adoption?*  
- Explore the data structure, variables, and distributions using R and SQL.  
- Perform joins between the **EV** and **Alternative Fuel** datasets on location identifiers (state, city, ZIP).  
- Visualize findings using Tableau dashboards.

---

## Tools Used
- **R** for data cleaning, profiling, and transformation.  
- **SQL (MySQL)** for joining datasets and querying insights.  
- **Excel** for validation and quick exploration.  
- **Tableau** for visualization and storytelling.
